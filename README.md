# Scanning-Using-Owasp-Zap
This project demonstrates the fundamental functions of an open-source web application security scanner called OWASP ZAP by using its various tools for penetration testing.

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security tool that helps to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.  The tool is designed for both security professionals and novice users and provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use.

One of the primary features of OWASP ZAP is its ability to detect common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It does this by intercepting the requests and responses between the web application and the client.

OWASP ZAP also provides a range of automated testing tools that can be used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. These tools include the spider, which automatically crawls a website to identify all the pages and links, and the active scanner, which actively probes the application to identify any potential security weaknesses. In addition, OWASP ZAP also includes a manual testing mode, which allows security professionals to manually explore the application and identify any vulnerabilities.
